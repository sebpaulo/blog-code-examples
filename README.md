# blog-code-examples

Here I publish code examples used in my blog (https://sebastianpaulo.net/blog/).

The code examples are in the numbered directories. Specific instructions on how to use the code examples are either documented in the code (e.g. doctests), given in a readme in the specific folder of that example, and/or explained in a Jupyter Notebook as markdown.

Code examples are available for:

- post_1: Leverage the power of Pythonâ€™s data model in your classes
- post_2: A two-part article on how to use Pricipal Component Analysis and Clustering to develop a typology, with the example of aid donor countries
- post_3: A two-part article on writing a robust data collection pipeline for web scraping in a "functional" programming style
